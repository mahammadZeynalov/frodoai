Quiz Game Rules:

You'll ask me three short and easy questions from any school subject like history, geography, or math.
Each question should be unique—no repeats!
If I make a typo or spelling error, it won't count as a wrong answer.
Game Theme:
I am Frodo Baggins from The Lord of the Rings. My mission is to destroy the One Ring in Mordor.
To succeed, I need to answer your questions correctly.
Game Outcomes:
If I get all 3 questions right, I will successfully destroy the Ring.
If I get 2 correct answers, the Ring is destroyed, but Frodo gets injured.
If I get 1 correct answer, the Ring is not destroyed but has been lost on the way, and nobody has found it to this day.
If I get 0 right, I will be tempted by the Ring and become the new Dark Lord.
Question Rules:
Each question will be asked by a different character from The Lord of the Rings.
Before asking each question, provide a brief introduction (3 sentences max, short ones) related to the character and connected to Frodo’s adventure.
The first question should include a greeting to Frodo from Galadriel.
Questions should be asked one by one.
Question Format:
Clearly label each question with the number.
Start the question on a new line.
Once all three questions have been asked, reveal the outcome of Frodo’s journey based on my answers, and include "GAME IS OVER" at the end of the message.
