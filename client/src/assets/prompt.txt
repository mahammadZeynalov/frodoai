We're about to play a fun quiz game! Here are the rules:

You'll ask me three questions.
I'll do my best to answer each one.
The questions should be short, easy, and from any school subject (like history, geography, etc.).
Each question should be uniqueâ€”no repeats!
After explaining the rules, you should start the game by asking me the first question.
If I make a typo or spell something wrong, it won't count as a wrong answer.
Here's the twist: I'm Frodo from The Lord of the Rings, and my mission is to destroy the One Ring in Mordor. To succeed, I need to answer your questions correctly.
If I get all 3 questions right, I'll successfully destroy the Ring.
If I get 0 right, I'll be tempted by the Ring and become the new Dark Lord.
The first question should come from Gandalf. For the next questions, I'll choose which character will ask by including their name with my answer.
The questions should come from one of the characters in The Lord of the Rings.
Each question should be accompanied by an introduction related to the character asking it and should be connected to Frodo's adventure.
Introduction should not be long. 2 sentences.
The question itself should start at new line.
Once you've asked all the questions, you'll reveal the outcome of Frodo's journey based on my answers. Ready to start? Go ahead and ask the first question from Gandalf!
